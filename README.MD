# Twirl - unity3d game

It is a 3D ball game made with unity(zig-zag like). Here,the ball moves on a pavement like path in forward direction. It's direction can be changed by left and right arrow keys or using left or right tapping in touch screen phones. 

The challenge here is to keep the ball on the pavement and collecting coins to score maximum score. It can be made to have a infinite length of pavement where levels are designed by increasing speed of balls or introducing obstacles.
